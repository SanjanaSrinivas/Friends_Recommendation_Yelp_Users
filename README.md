# Friends_Recommendation_Yelp_Users

User’s circle of friends influence decisions on services they would want to take. We are more likely to avail a certain service previously used and liked by our friend.Therefore, it becomes more and more important to identify community of like-minded people and then suggestfriends based on their interest match. Present socialnetworking sites recommend friends to users based on their social connections or geographical location, etc. It's a state-of-the-art approach of recommending friends that is based on the idea of grouping users who review businesses similarly into a community and then recommending friends within their community who are similar with respect to certain user attributes. It may be worthwhile for users with similar reviewing patterns and behaviors to search other’s activity. This approach involves applying various community detection algorithms on a graph of users and further suggesting friends from same community who are similar to them.
